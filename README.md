Hi,
My name is **Aashar Wahla**, and I am full stack flutter developer for over 4 years. And I am building a project called **HabitTracker**.
There are many things that I will add in the project which are as follow:

 1. Multiple habbit
 2. User authentication using email & password
 3. Notification Time Setter for each habbit
 4. Firebase Firestore - Realtime Database
 5. Track user habbit
 6. No ads and premium version
 7. Graphs
 8. Beautiful Animations

I will start working on the project from **27 January, 2020** and hopefully the project will be completed in less than a month.
