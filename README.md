Hi,
My name is **Aashar Wahla**, and I am full stack flutter developer for over 4 years. And I am building a project called **HabitTracker**.
There are many things that I will add in the project which are as follow:

 1. Multiple habbit
 2. Notification Time Setter for each habbit
 3. SQL - on device datbase will be used
 4. All of the user data will be stored with in the device
 5. No ads and premium version
 6. Graphs
 7. Beautiful Animations

I will start working on the project from **27 January, 2020** and hopefully the project will be completed in less than a month.
